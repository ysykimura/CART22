## Euiyong Park:Extended crystals and Hernandez-Leclerc categories
In this talk, we talk about the categorical crystal structure on the Hernandez-Leclerc category ${\mathscr{C}}^0_{\mathfrak{g}}$. WeÂ introduce the notion of extended crystals for a quantum group, which can be viewed as the product of infinite copies of the infinite crystal $B(\infty)$, and explain how the set of the isomorphism classes of simple modules in ${\mathscr{C}}^0_{\mathfrak{g}}$ has an extended crystal structure. We then discuss the Braid group action on an extended crystal, and explain a connection to the Hernandez-Leclerc category ${\mathscr{C}}^0_{\mathfrak{g}}$. This talk is partially based on a joint work with M. Kashiwara (arXiv: 2111.07255 and 2207.11644).

## Fan Qin:Bracelets bases are theta bases
It is known that the bracelets form a basis for the Skein algebra associated with an unpunctured surface. We construct quantum bracelets for quantum cluster algebras arising from a surface (possibly with punctures). We further show that, except for once-punctured tori, the (quantum) bracelets coincide with the (quantum) theta functions, which form the theta basis. Long-standing conjectures such as strong positivity and atomicity follow as consequences. This is a joint work with Travis Mandel.
